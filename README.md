A protective box providing an additional protection layer for healthcare provider while intubating a patient or performing other procedures. Other PPEs such as glasses, masks and face shields are necessary -- the box is only an additional physical barrier.

The box design is based on Dr. Yung-Laiâ€™s Aerosol Box (https://sites.google.com/view/aerosolbox/design) and a slanted design by EverythingAcrylic in Philippines (https://www.facebook.com/everythingacrylic.ph/). Currently we are prototyping and testing a v.1.2 design with Santaros Klinikos in Vilnius, Lithuania. The main changes from the original Dr. Yung-Lai's design, based on feedback from an ICU doctor:

 * Slanted top, providing better access and visibility to the doctor
 * The box is wider and longer
 * The bottom and top corners are rounded (the sides are CNC milled from polycarbonate or cut from another durable plastic), meaning there are fewer sharp corners and it is easier to clean.
 * The hand holes are larger and elliptical

v.1.2 is still in production as of March 29th 2020, this is a preliminary design. Use at your own risk.

v.1.3 is an updated version with straight sides (no plastic bending).

v.1.1 (https://github.com/Technariumas/AerosolBox/blob/master/AerosolBox-slanted-5mm.dxf) features a slanted top, glued from several separate pieces of 5mm acrylic. The box would be more rigid if the sides are made from 8mm thick sheet. The drawing must be adjusted for that. 

v.1.1 in testing:
